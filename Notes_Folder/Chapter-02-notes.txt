Uses of the parcel:

Creation of the server: http:://localhost:1234 ( for https) [npx build parcel.html https]
Hot module Replacement
File watcher algorithm
Bundling
Minify
Cleaning our code [ removing console.logs]
Dev and production build
Super fast build algorithm
Image optimisation
caching while development
compression
compatible with older version of browser [injection of polyfills]
HTTPS on dev
port number
consistent hashing algorithm
zero config
Tree-shaking [removing unwanted code] - if we have 10 functions and only 2 are used rest will be removed

==========================================================
git init - helps you to get the .getignore file and all the necessary things in
order to interact with the git

npm init- provides you with all the package.json necessary to provides with options that are needed
like entry point etc.

npm init --y/--yes- this will automatically populate all the options with the default npm init values.

npm run -D parcel - gives us with the package-lock json and devDependencies section

BrowserList =  this is something that makes the code compatibale and to be working in the versions
as per the conditions mentioned in the List. Actually, Babel will do this for us and we dont need to
write polyfill for this.

npm init = iniate the npm. It will package.json file.

scripts will be helping us in execution of commmnds
to build: npx parcel build index.html
to start: npm parcel index.html
where index.html specifies the entry point.

npm start is same as npm run start
