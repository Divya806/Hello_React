Default Exports and Named Exports
Whenever we have 2 components and we need to export them we will export default the one with same
file name(basically component name) 

Default Import 
import Header from './components/Header';
Named Import
import {Title } from "./compoenents/Title;

We can also use below which imports everthing in file and we can use it
import * as Obj from "./components/Header";

< Obj.Title />

This is the we are React.Fragment in the code
<React.Fragment>
<Header>
<Body>
</Footer>
</React.Fragment>

If we have the default Header from the Header component then by default,
the component can be set as anything.

For example: even when we ahve export default Header in the Header.js

import NewHeader from './components/Header";

=========================================================
We can put the file format at the end as well:

import NewHeader from './components/Header.js";
import NewHeader from './components/Header.jsx";

We can use both .js as well as .jsx for react components
