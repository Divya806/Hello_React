Default Exports and Named Exports
Whenever we have 2 components and we need to export them we will export default the one with same
file name(basically component name) 

Default Import 
import Header from './components/Header';
Named Import
import {Title } from "./compoenents/Title;

We can also use below which imports everthing in file and we can use it
import * as Obj from "./components/Header";

< Obj.Title />

This is the we are React.Fragment in the code
<React.Fragment>
<Header>
<Body>
</Footer>
</React.Fragment>

If we have the default Header from the Header component then by default,
the component can be set as anything.

For example: even when we ahve export default Header in the Header.js

import NewHeader from './components/Header";

===============================================================
We can put the file format at the end as well:

import NewHeader from './components/Header.js";
import NewHeader from './components/Header.jsx";

We can use both .js as well as .jsx for react components

Creation of searchcomponent in Body

When we write a input tag in html file it works fine but whenever we write the same in React
or JSx file, it will not work. we can understand that it is somehow controlled by react.

<input type="text" placeholder="search" value="" />

React uses something known as one-way data binding. 
Wheneever we need to modify, we need to use the dynaic values.
let a = 10;
that is we will be able to update only one value at the time.
<div>{a}</div>

We can just update only one value, but when we want to re-render we can use of the state variable

What is state?
We use state in order to maintain local variables in js.

what is Hook?
Hook Is just a normal Javascript functions. theses functions give some functianlities.

What is useState?
useState is the hook that is developed by the facebook developers in order to make use of them
in the creation of the local variables.
It comes from React library.

We import it as below: [named import]
import {useState} from 'react';

to give default value, we do as below:
const [searchTXT] = useState("KFC");

if we assign some value and we are able to change, its called two way data-bidning;

useState function returns an array in which first variable is the local varaible and second
parameter is a fucntion that is used to change the value;
const [searchTxt, setSearchTxt] = useState("KFC"); 

We can write as below as well:
const searchVar = useState();
const [searchText, setSearchTxt] = searchvar;

its written as naming convention as array and there is no reason behind it.

synthetic evernts - e.target.value
===================================================================================
Why do we need state varaibles?
React has one way data-binding, in order to make it two-way data bidning:
And also;

const a = 10l;
Whenever variables changes, React will re-render the DOM using the state varaibles so we will not use the
local varaibles.
To be in sync with the DOM, we need to use the state varaibles.

only a part of varible which is getting updated will re-render and this is why React is so fast.
This is called reconciliation.
