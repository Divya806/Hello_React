Emmet in Visual Studio Code: Emmet is a built-in feature in Visual Studio Code. You donâ€™t have to install any extensions for emmet support. Emmet prevents you from writing the entire code by yourself by providing Emmet abbreviation. 
Emmets for HTML:
1. Creating an Element by its name. for eg: h1 and enter to get <h1></h1>
2. Creating an Element with className. for eg: .gfgh <div class="gfgh"></div>
3. Creating an Element with Id. for eg: #testing <div id="testing></div>
4. Creating nested elements. ul>li* 4 
<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

Cross-origin - helps to get the data downloaded from the third-party server
The crossorigin attribute, valid on the <audio>, <img>, <link>, <script>, and <video> elements, provides support for CORS, defining how the element handles cross-origin requests, thereby enabling the configuration of the CORS requests for the element's fetched data. Depending on the element, the attribute can be a CORS settings attribute.

The crossorigin content attribute on media elements is a CORS settings attribute.

These attributes are enumerated, and have the following possible values:

anonymous
Request uses CORS headers and credentials flag is set to 'same-origin'. There is no exchange of user credentials via cookies, client-side SSL certificates or HTTP authentication, unless destination is the same origin.

use-credentials
Request uses CORS headers, credentials flag is set to 'include' and user credentials are always included.

""
Setting the attribute name to an empty value, like crossorigin or crossorigin="", is the same as anonymous.

CDN = content delivery network
A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a group of servers spread out over many locations. These servers store duplicate copies of data so that servers can fulfill data requests based on which servers are closest to the respective end-users. CDNs make for fast service less affected by high traffic.

Library and framework

Framweork : It comprises of lot of APIs , compilers , support programs , libraries etc. It is difficult to replace frameworks. A framework development requires a lot of code that decrease performance and increase the load time. Including framework smoothly into an existing project is impossible.

Library: It is a collection of helper modules , classes , objects , functions , pre-written code , etc.
A library is easy to be replaced with another library. Libraries can be integrated easily into existing projects to add some specific functionality.

============================================================================================================

Uses of the parcel:

Creation of the server: http:://localhost:1234 ( for https) [npx build parcel.html https]
Hot module Replacement
File watcher algorithm
Bundling
Minify
Cleaning our code [ removing console.logs]
Dev and production build
Super fast build algorithm
Image optimisation
caching while development
compression
compatible with older version of browser [injection of polyfills]
HTTPS on dev
port number
consistent hashing algorithm
zero config
Tree-shaking [removing unwanted code] - if we have 10 functions and only 2 are used rest will be removed

==========================================================
git init - helps you to get the .getignore file and all the necessary things in
order to interact with the git

npm init- provides you with all the package.json necessary to provides with options that are needed
like entry point etc.

npm init --y/--yes- this will automatically populate all the options with the default npm init values.

npm run -D parcel - gives us with the package-lock json and devDependencies section

BrowserList =  this is something that makes the code compatibale and to be working in the versions
as per the conditions mentioned in the List. Actually, Babel will do this for us and we dont need to
write polyfill for this.
